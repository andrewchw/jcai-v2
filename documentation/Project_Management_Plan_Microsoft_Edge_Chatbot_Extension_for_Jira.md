# Project Management Plan: Microsoft Edge Chatbot Extension for Jira Action Item Management

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a Microsoft Edge extension with a chatbot interface that enables teams to manage Jira action items through natural language commands. The system will automate task creation, reminders, and evidence tracking while maintaining firewall compliance. The solution leverages the Atlassian Python API for Jira Cloud integration and a free open-source LLM API (OpenRouter) for conversational intelligence.

## Project Structure
- **Edge Extension**: Chromium-based sidebar UI for natural language task management
- **Python Server**: Backend for LLM processing and Jira API communication
- **Atlassian Python API**: Library for Jira Cloud interactions
- **Database**: SQLite for caching task data

## Task Management Instructions
- Tasks are tagged as Done, ToDo, or Backlog
- Priority is indicated by the order in each list
- Tasks must include assignee, due date, and description where applicable

## Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Jira API changes | Medium | High | Use Atlassian Python API which handles versioning, monitor Atlassian announcements |
| OpenRouter API limitations | High | Medium | Implement request throttling, consider fallback LLM options |
| Firewall restrictions | Medium | High | Document network requirements, test in isolated environment |
| OAuth token expiration | Low | Medium | Implement robust token refresh mechanism using Atlassian Python API |
| Browser version compatibility | Low | Medium | Test on multiple Edge versions, use polyfills where needed |

## Team Roles & Responsibilities
- Project Manager: Overall coordination, timeline management, status reporting
- Frontend Developer: Edge extension UI, browser notifications, OAuth flow
- Backend Developer: Python server, LLM integration, Atlassian API integration
- DevOps: Environment setup, intranet deployment, security compliance
- QA Engineer: Testing strategy, test case development, bug verification

## Communication Plan
- Daily standup: 15 minutes, 9:00 AM
- Weekly progress review: 1 hour, Mondays at 11:00 AM
- Monthly stakeholder demo: 1 hour, last Friday of each month
- Issue tracking: Jira board with up-to-date status
