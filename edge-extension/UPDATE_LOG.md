- **Removed gradient background**: Changed from `linear-gradient(135deg, #0052cc, #0065ff)` to `transparent`
- **Removed border**: Eliminated the `border: 2px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`
- **Updated shadow**: Changed from JIRA blue shadow to neutral `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`
- **Increased icon size**: From 24x24px to 40x40px to utilize the higher resolution
- **Updated pulse ring**: Changed from JIRA blue to subtle `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`

### 3. Updated Icon Implementation
- **Switched to icon128.png**: Using higher resolution icon for better quality
- **Larger display size**: 40x40px (up from 24x24px)
- **Clean appearance**: No background placeholder, just the icon image
- **Fallback text color**: Changed from white to dark gray `#333` for better visibility

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness

- Maintains proportions with the larger icon

## Testing Instructions

1. **Load Extension**: Go to `edge://extensions/` and reload the JIRA Chatbot Assistant
2. **Visit any website**: The hover icon should appear with the clean JIRA icon (no background)
3. **Check appearance**: 
   - Icon should be larger and clearer (128px source scaled to 40px display)
   - No blue gradient background
   - Clean, professional appearance
   - Subtle shadow and hover effects
4. **Test functionality**: Click should still open the sidebar
5. **Test fallback**: If icon doesn't load, should show dark "JC" text

## Key Benefits

- **Higher quality icon**: Using 128px source for crisp display
- **Clean appearance**: No distracting background colors
- **Better integration**: More subtle and professional look
- **Scalable**: Higher resolution works better on high-DPI displays
