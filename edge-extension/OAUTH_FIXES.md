# OAuth Authentication Flow Fixes

This update addresses critical issues with the OAuth authentication flow in the Jira Chatbot Edge extension.

## Problems Fixed

1. **User ID Handling**:
   - Fixed issue where "undefined" was being sent as the user ID during login
   - Ensured consistent user ID usage between login and API calls
   - Added proper fallback mechanisms when user ID is missing

2. **Endpoint URL Mismatch**:
   - Updated token status endpoint from `/api/auth/oauth/v2/status` to `/api/auth/oauth/v2/token/status`
   - Eliminated 404 errors that were occurring in server logs

3. **Authentication State Management**:
   - Improved state tracking in the tokenState object
   - Added multiple validity checks to properly determine authentication status
   - Enhanced error handling for status checks

4. **UI Update Mechanism**:
   - Fixed sidebar UI not updating after successful authentication
   - Added multiple notification methods to ensure UI receives updates
   - Implemented local storage fallbacks for state persistence

5. **Communication Reliability**:
   - Enhanced port-based messaging between background and sidebar
   - Improved error handling in messaging code
   - Added reconnection logic to ensure reliable communication

6. **Callback Detection Enhancement**:
   - Improved OAuth callback URL parsing to better detect successful authentication
   - Added support for implicit success detection from OAuth code parameter
   - Fixed issue where callback page might show "Authentication failed" despite successful authentication

## Files Modified

- `background.js`: Main extension script handling OAuth
- `sidebar.js`: UI script for the extension sidebar 

## Implementation Details

### In `background.js`:

- **User ID Storage**: Added explicit user ID setting before initiating auth and consistent retrieval
- **Token Status Endpoint**: Fixed URL to match server implementation
- **Auth Success Detection**: Enhanced criteria for detecting successful authentication
- **Authentication Notification**: Added dedicated function for reliable sidebar notification
- **Connection Handling**: Improved sidebar connection initialization with current auth state
- **Service Worker Context**: Replaced all `window` references with `self` to fix "window is not defined" errors
- **Interval Management**: Fixed token check interval management using service worker context

### In `sidebar.js`:

- **Initialization**: Added storage checks during initialization to restore auth state
- **Auth Status Updates**: Enhanced how auth status is received and displayed
- **Token Status Display**: Improved validation and display of token information
- **Communication Resilience**: Added reconnection and recovery logic
- **Event Listener Tracking**: Replaced window-based listener tracking with storage-based tracking for better resilience

## Testing

Test the complete authentication flow to confirm that:
1. The UI updates correctly after login
2. The token status is correctly displayed
3. The user ID remains consistent throughout the process

## How to Apply Changes

Run the included patch script:

```powershell
.\apply_oauth_patches.ps1
```

This will:
1. Back up your current background.js file
2. Apply all the fixes to the authentication flow
3. Preserve your existing configuration

If you encounter any issues, the original file is backed up and can be restored.
