r"""Complete Jira Update Fix Summary.

This file documents the complete fix for the Jira issue update functionality.
The issue was that the chat window showed failure messages even when the Jira
update was successful.

PROBLEM:
- update_issue() method in JiraService was using wrong method signature
- update_issue_field returns None even on successful updates
- Chat response logic was checking "if result:" which failed for None values

SOLUTION:
1. Fixed the method signature in JiraService.update_issue()
2. Fixed the response handling logic in chat.py to assume success if no exception

CHANGES MADE:

1. File: c:\\Users\\deencat\\Documents\\jcai-v2\\python-server\\app\\services\\jira_service.py
   Lines: 452-470 (update_issue method)

   OLD: result = self._client.update_issue(issue_key=issue_key, fields=fields)
   NEW: result = self._client.update_issue_field(key=issue_key, fields=fields)

2. File: c:\\Users\\deencat\\Documents\\jcai-v2\\python-server\\app\\api\\endpoints\\chat.py
   Lines: 515-521 (response handling logic)

   OLD:
   if result:
       return {"success": True, ...}
   else:
       return {"success": False, ...}

   NEW:
   # The update_issue_field method returns None even on success
   # If we reach this point without an exception, the update was successful
   return {"success": True, ...}

TESTING:
- Response handling logic verified with unit tests
- Both success and failure cases tested
- Confirms that successful updates now show success messages

RESULT:
✅ Chat window will now correctly show "✅ Updated priority for JCAI-120 to 'High'"
   instead of "❌ Failed to update JCAI-120"

✅ Jira issue updates work correctly (they were working before, but now chat shows success)
